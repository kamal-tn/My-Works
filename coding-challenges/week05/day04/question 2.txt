let x = 50
function func(x) {
console.log('x is', x)             // here the value of x will be 50
x = 2                                     // now reassigning the value of x with 2
console.log('Changed local x to', x)   // prints the reassigned value which is 2
}
func(x)                    // but here the x value will be 50 only; because we have assigned the new value to x within the function block only
console.log('x is now', x)


OUTPUT:

x is 50
Changed local x to 2
x is now 50
