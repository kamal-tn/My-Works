Steps to build the max heap:

1) find the 1st non leaf node
2) to find index of 1st non leaf node, Math.floor (n/2)-1
3) run a loop from 1st non leaf node to root node by calling heapify algorithm

Heapify algorithm:

1) compare left child (2i+1) and right child (2i+2) and find the largest
2) now compare the largest with the root node,
     a) if root > largest, nothing will happen
      b) if root < largest, swap them
3) call this algorithm recursively
