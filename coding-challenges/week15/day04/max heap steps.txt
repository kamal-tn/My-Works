steps to convert an invalid max heap into a valid one:

1) create a function 
2) to traverse through left sub tree l = 2*i+1
3) to traverse through right sub tree r = 2*i+2
4) create a largest variable
5) compare left and right side and store it in a temp variable
6) check between largest and temp variable
7) swap the variable
8) call the function recursively


Time complexity: O (log n)
Space complexity: O (1)
