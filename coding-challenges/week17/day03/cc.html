    <h4><p><i style="font-size: 25px;"> HyperText Markup Language or HTML </i> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank"> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> and scripting languages such as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p></h4>
        <h2 style="color: red ;"><u>History</u></h2>
        <h4><p>In 1980, physicist <i style="font-size: 25px;">Tim Berners-Lee</i>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p></h4>
